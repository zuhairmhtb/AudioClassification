# AudioClassification
This software is a demonstration of Audio Signal Processing and Machine Learning using Python and Tensorflow.  The software contains a GUI that can stream audio via webcams or external audio devices connected to the computer and process the audio in real time using a Convolutional and/or a Recurrent Neural Network in order to perform audio classification like speech recognition, music classification, etc. (Depending on how the network was trained). The data set can be arranged in directories where the name of a parent directory represents a classification class. In this way a single network can be trained for multiple types of binary independent audio data eventually building a complex neural network.
